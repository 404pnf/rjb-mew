title: Fix you
---



原唱：Coldplay 　　

When you try your best but you don’t succeedWhen you get what you want but not what you needWhen you feel so tired but you can’t sleepStuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your faceWhen you lose something you cannot replaceWhen you love someone but it goes to wasteCould it be worse?

Lights will guide you homeAnd ignite your bonesAnd I will try to fix you

And high up above or down belowWhen you’re too in love to let it goBut if you never try you’ll never knowJust what you’re worth

Lights will guide you homeAnd ignite your bonesAnd I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your faceWhen you lose something you cannot replaceTears stream down your faceAnd I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your faceI promise you I will learn from my mistakesTears stream down your faceAnd I will try to fix you

Lights will guide you homeAnd ignite your bonesAnd I will try to fix you
