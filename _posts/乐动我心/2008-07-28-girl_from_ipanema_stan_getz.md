title: Girl from Ipanema - Stan Getz
---



Tall and tan and young and lovelyThe girl from Ipanema goes walkingAnd when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she’s like a sambaThat swings so cool and sways so gentleThat when she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh(Ooh) But I watch her so sadlyHow can I tell her I love herYes I would give my heart gladlyBut each day, when she walks to the seaShe looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovelyThe girl from Ipanema goes walkingAnd when she passes, I smilebut she doesn’t see (doesn’t see)

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graçaÉ ela menina que vem e que passaNum doce balanço a caminho do mar…

Moça do corpo dourado do sol de IpanemaO seu balançado é mais que um poemaÉ a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar…

(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly(Ahh) porque tudo é tão tristeYes I would give my heart gladlyBut each day, when she walks to the seaShe looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, and tan, and young, and lovelyThe girl from Ipanema goes walkingAnd when she passes, I smilebut she doesn’t seePor causa do Amor

She just doesn’t seeNem olha para mimShe never seem mePor causa do Amor…
