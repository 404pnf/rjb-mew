title: Our last summer

I can still recall our last summerI still see it allWalks along the seine, laughing in the rainOur last summerMemories that remain

We made our way along the riverAnd we sat down in the grassBy the eiffel towerI was so happy we had metIt was the age of no regretOh yesThose crazy years, that was the timeOf the flower-powerBut underneath we had a fear of flyingOf getting old, a fear of slowly dyingWe took the chanceLike we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summerI still see it allIn the tourist jam, round the notre dameOur last summerWalking hand in hand

Paris restaurantsOur last summerMorning croissantsLiving for the day, worries far awayOur last summerWe could laugh and play

And now you’re working in a bankThe family man, the football fanAnd your name is harryHow dull it seemsYet you’re the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summerI still see it allWalks along the seine, laughing in the rainOur last summerMemories that remainI can still recall our last summerI still see it allIn the tourist jam, round the notre dameOur last summerWalking hand in handParis restaurantsOur last summerMorning croissantsLiving for the day, worries far away
