---





Oh,Why you look so sad?Tears are in your eyesCome on and come to me nowDon’t be ashamed to cryLet me see you through‘Cause I’ve seen the dark side tooWhen the night falls on youYou don’t know what to doNothing you confessCould make me you love you less

I’ll stand by youI’ll stand by youWon’t let nobody hurt youI’ll stand by you

So if you’re mad, get madDon’t hold it all insideCome on and talk to me nowHey, what you got to hide?I get angry tooWell I’m a lot like youWhen you’re standing at the crossroadsAnd don’t know which path to chooseLet me come along‘Cause even if you’re wrong

I’ll stand by youI’ll stand by youWon’t let nobody hurt youI’ll stand by you

Take me in, into your darkest hourAnd I’ll never desert youI’ll stand by you

And whenWhen the night falls on you babyYou’re feeling all aloneYou won’t be on your own

I’ll stand by youI’ll stand by youWon’t let nobody hurt youI’ll stand by you

Take me in, into your darkest hourAnd I’ll never desert you

I’ll stand by you(I’ll stand by you)I’ll stand by you(I’ll stand by you)Won’t let nobody hurt youI’ll stand by you(I’ll stand by you)(I’ll stand by you)(Take me into your darkest hour)Won’t let nobody hurt you(I’ll stand by you)(I’ll stand by you)
