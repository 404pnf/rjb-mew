lyrics:We’re walking in the airWe’re floating in the moonlit skyThe people far below are sleeping as we flyI’m holding very tightI’m riding in the midnight blueI’m finding I can fly so high above with youOn across the worldThe villages go by like dreamsThe rivers and the hillsThe forests and the streamsChildren gaze open mouthedTaken by surpriseNobody down below believes their eyesWe’re surfing in the airWe are swimming in the frozen skyWe are drifting over icy mountains floating bySuddenly swooping lowOn an ocean deepRousing up a mighty monster from its sleepWe’re walking in the airwe’re dancing in the midnight skyAnd everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
