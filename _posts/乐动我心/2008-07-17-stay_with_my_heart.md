title: Stay With My Heart
---





Fell in love with my lover in the morningOr maybe I fell long before youNow I wonder what lovers are missingAnd how the name seems to me passing through

It’s so sad but maybe you’re self-caused troublePerhaps I’ve been sad longer than youI might have been fooling my loverYou have always been so much more to me

Ain’t got the heart babyI ain’t got the heartGo with the morningI’ll stay with my heart

I ain’t got the heart babyI ain’t got the heartGo with the morningI’ll stay with my heartStay with my heart

You know I was sent for that morningOr maybe it just was the night that threw me out

I ain’t got the heart babyI ain’t got the heartGo with the morningI’ll stay with my heart

I ain’t got the heartI ain’t got the heartGo with the morningI’ll stay with my heartI’ll stay with my heartI’ll stay with my heart
