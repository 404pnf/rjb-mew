I used to think that love was just a fairy taleuntil that first hellountil that first smilebut if i had to do it all againi wouldn’t change a thingcause this love is everlasting

suddenly life has new meaning to methere’s beauty up aboveand things we never take notice ofyou wake up and suddenly you’re in love

girl you’re everything a man could want and morea thousand words are not enoughto say what i feel insideholding hands as we walk along the shorenever felt like this beforenow you’re all i’m living for　repeat *

each day i pray this love affair would last forever woo　repeat *　there’s beauty up above and things we never take notice ofyou wake up and suddenly you’re in love
