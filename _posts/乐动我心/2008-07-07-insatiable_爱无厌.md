title: Insatiable 爱无厌
---





When moonlight crawls along the streetChasing away the summer heatFootsteps outside somewhere belowThe world revolves I’ve let it goWe build our church above the streetWe practiced love between these sheetsThe candy sweetness scent of youIt bathes my skin I’m stained of youAnd all I have to do is hold youThere’s a racing within my heartAnd I am barely touching you

[Chorus]

Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiable

The moonlight plays upon your skinA kiss that lingers takes me inI fall asleep inside of youThere are no wordsThere’s only truthBreathe in breathe outThere is no soundWe move together up and downWe levitate our bodies soarOur feet don’t even touch the floorBut nobody knows you like I do‘Cause the world may not understandThat I grow stronger in your hands

[Chorus]

Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiable

Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiable

We never sleep we’re always holdin’ handsKissin’ for hours talkin’ makin’ plansI feel like a better manJust being in the same roomWe never sleep there’s just so much to doSo much to sayCan’t close my eyes when I’m with youInsatiable the way I’m loving you

[Chorus]

Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiable

Turn the lights down lowTake it offLet me showMy love for youInsatiableTurn me onNever stopWanna taste every dropMy love for youInsatiable
