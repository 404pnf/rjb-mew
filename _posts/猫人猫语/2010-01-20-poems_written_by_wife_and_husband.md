title: Poems written by WIFE and HUSBAND
---



WIFE:I wrote your name on sand it got washed.I wrote your name in air, it was blown away. ThenI wrote your name on my heart & I got Heart Attack..

HUSBAND:God saw me hungry, he created pizza.He saw me thirsty, he created Pepsi.He saw me in dark, he created light.He saw me without problems, he created YOU.

WIFE:Twinkle twinkle little starYou should know what you areAnd once you know what you areMental hospital is not so far.

HUSBAND:The rain makes all things beautiful.The grass and flowers too.If rain makes all things beautifulWhy doesn’t it rain on you?

WIFE:Roses are red; Violets are blueMonkeys like u should be kept in zoo.Don’t feel so angry you will find me there tooNot in cage but laughing at you.
